# Node Hello World

Simple node.js app that servers "hello world"

Great for testing simple deployments to the cloud

## Run It

`npm start`

# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "master" branch.
